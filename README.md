# Sample Projects for Final Project - Internet and Web Services
Hi students,
In this repository, I will provide to you 10 sample projects for the Final Project of the course Internet and Web Services \
The details of these projects will be described below. Most of them will be MERN stack, but some of them will be other tech-stack, even for the database. \
If you want to try it, remember that after you downloaded the code, you need to install libraries and replace the MongoDB Atlas URL to your own link and password. \
For projects not using MERN stack, make sure that you had prepared all necessary libraries and configuration. \
